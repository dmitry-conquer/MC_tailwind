            Professional teeth whitening or in-office whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure that involves the use of bleaching agents to lighten the color of your teeth,
            resulting in whiter teeth. This helps you achieve a more radiant and attractive appearance, making you feel more comfortable and confident in social situations.

              <a href="#" class="underline">Teeth whitening</a> is not something everyone should use. When you visit us, we will provide an examination to ensure your teeth are
              healthy enough for this procedure. We will then work closely with you to choose the proper method for your case. Many times, teeth bleaching methods work well to
              remove stains and discoloration, but they do not work to resolve cavities or gum problems. We need to address those concerns first in most cases.

          <p class="!mb-5 text-base font-normal text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">Here's what we look out for to determine if you are eligible for in-office teeth whitening:</p>
          <div class="[&>ul]:pl-6 [&>ul>li]:text-base [&>ul>li]:sm:text-lg [&>ul>li]:[list-style-type:disc]">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Teeth sensitivity. Some may experience severe sensitivity from tooth whitening procedures. This can be exacerbated by the use of bleaching agents, making it an
                uncomfortable and potentially harmful procedure for those with sensitive teeth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gum Disease. People with gum disease should avoid teeth whitening as it can aggravate the condition and cause further damage to their gums. It's important to treat
                any existing gum disease before considering a whitening treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tooth Decay. Teeth whitening does not work on cavities or decaying teeth, so patients have to treat any underlying dental issues before undergoing this procedure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Restorations. If patients have dental crowns, fillings or veneers, they will not respond well to teeth whitening treatments. This can result in uneven and
                inconsistent tooth color, making the overall appearance less desirable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enamel Erosion. The tooth enamel is the protective layer of our teeth. Once it erodes, it cannot be restored. Teeth whitening can accelerate enamel erosion, leading
                to increased sensitivity and a higher risk of tooth decay.
              </li>
              <li>
                Age. As we age, our teeth naturally become darker as the enamel wears down and reveals the yellow dentin underneath. Teeth whitening may not be effective for older
                patients as their teeth may not respond well to bleaching agents.
              </li>
              Pregnancy or Breastfeeding. We recommend avoiding teeth whitening during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, as the effects of the bleaching agents on a developing baby
              are not yet known.
              <li>
                Allergies. Some people may have allergies to the ingredients in teeth whitening products, which can cause adverse reactions such as swelling, redness and
                discomfort.
              </li>
              <li>
                Medications. Certain medications like tetracycline can cause tooth discoloration that cannot be corrected with teeth whitening. If a patient is taking any
                medications, they should tell us immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tobacco Products. Smoking or using other tobacco products can stain the teeth and make them resistant to whitening treatments. It's recommended to get rid of
                smoking habits before considering a teeth whitening procedure for optimal results.Â

      <p class="mb-10 text-center text-base font-normal text-zinc-800 sm:mb-[56px] sm:text-lg">
        The following are normal conditions you can expect immediately after your teeth whitening procedure, but should subside after a few days:
      </p>
      <div class="flex flex-row-reverse items-center gap-x-[30px] gap-y-7 max-lg:flex-col">
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-5 pl-4 lg:w-1/2">
          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Tooth Sensitivity. It is normal to experience increased sensitivity in your teeth after a whitening treatment. This is often temporary and should subside within a few
            days. To help reduce sensitivity, avoid consuming hot or cold drinks and foods immediately after the treatment. You can also use desensitizing toothpaste to help
            alleviate any discomfort.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Increased Whitening. Teeth may appear whiter immediately after the treatment, but this is often due to dehydration of the teeth from the whitening gel. As your teeth
            rehydrate over the next few days, you may notice a slight decrease in brightness. This is normal and your teeth will still be significantly whiter than before the
            treatment.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Gum Irritation. The whitening gel used during the treatment may irritate your gums if it comes in contact with them. This can cause temporary redness, soreness and
            irritation. To prevent this, your dentist will apply a protective gel or barrier to your gums before starting the treatment.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Temporary White Spots. Some patients may notice small white spots on their teeth after a whitening treatment. These are typically temporary and will fade over time.

            Brush and floss regularly. <br />
            Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for keeping your teeth clean and free from stains.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Avoid foods and beverages that can stain your teeth. <br />
            These include coffee, tea, soda, red wine and dark-colored foods like berries.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Use a straw. <br />
            Drinking staining beverages through a straw can help minimize the contact they have with your teeth.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Schedule regular dental exams and cleanings. <br />
            Regular checkups and cleanings can help keep your teeth healthy and catch any potential issues early on.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base text-zinc-800 sm:text-lg">
            Consider touch-up treatments. <br />
            Depending on your habits and lifestyle, you may need touch-up treatments every few months to maintain your desired level of whitening.
