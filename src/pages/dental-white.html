            Professional teeth whitening or in-office whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure that involves the use of bleaching agents to lighten the color of your teeth,
            resulting in whiter teeth. This helps you achieve a more radiant and attractive appearance, making you feel more comfortable and confident in social situations.

              <a href="#" class="underline">Teeth whitening</a> is not something everyone should use. When you visit us, we will provide an examination to ensure your teeth are
              healthy enough for this procedure. We will then work closely with you to choose the proper method for your case. Many times, teeth bleaching methods work well to
              remove stains and discoloration, but they do not work to resolve cavities or gum problems. We need to address those concerns first in most cases.

          <h2 class="mb-5 font-['Lusitana'] text-[32px] font-normal !leading-tight text-red-700">Who Is Not an Ideal Candidate for Teeth Whitening?</h2>
          <p class="sm:text-lg mb-5 text-base font-normal text-zinc-800">Here's what we look out for to determine if you are eligible for in-office teeth whitening:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Teeth sensitivity. Some may experience severe sensitivity from tooth whitening procedures. This can be exacerbated by the use of bleaching agents, making it an
              uncomfortable and potentially harmful procedure for those with sensitive teeth.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Gum Disease. People with gum disease should avoid teeth whitening as it can aggravate the condition and cause further damage to their gums. It's important to treat
              any existing gum disease before considering a whitening treatment.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Tooth Decay. Teeth whitening does not work on cavities or decaying teeth, so patients have to treat any underlying dental issues before undergoing this procedure.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Restorations. If patients have dental crowns, fillings or veneers, they will not respond well to teeth whitening treatments. This can result in uneven and
              inconsistent tooth color, making the overall appearance less desirable.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Enamel Erosion. The tooth enamel is the protective layer of our teeth. Once it erodes, it cannot be restored. Teeth whitening can accelerate enamel erosion, leading
              to increased sensitivity and a higher risk of tooth decay.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Age. As we age, our teeth naturally become darker as the enamel wears down and reveals the yellow dentin underneath. Teeth whitening may not be effective for older
              patients as their teeth may not respond well to bleaching agents.
            </li>
            Pregnancy or Breastfeeding. We recommend avoiding teeth whitening during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, as the effects of the bleaching agents on a developing baby
            are not yet known.
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Allergies. Some people may have allergies to the ingredients in teeth whitening products, which can cause adverse reactions such as swelling, redness and discomfort.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Medications. Certain medications like tetracycline can cause tooth discoloration that cannot be corrected with teeth whitening. If a patient is taking any
              medications, they should tell us immediately.
            </li>
            <li class="sm:text-lg text-base">
              Tobacco Products. Smoking or using other tobacco products can stain the teeth and make them resistant to whitening treatments. It's recommended to get rid of smoking
              habits before considering a teeth whitening procedure for optimal results.Â

          <li class="text-base sm:text-lg text-zinc-800">
            Brush and floss regularly. <br />
            Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for keeping your teeth clean and free from stains.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base sm:text-lg text-zinc-800">
            Avoid foods and beverages that can stain your teeth. <br />
            These include coffee, tea, soda, red wine and dark-colored foods like berries.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base sm:text-lg text-zinc-800">
            Use a straw. <br />
            Drinking staining beverages through a straw can help minimize the contact they have with your teeth.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base sm:text-lg text-zinc-800">
            Schedule regular dental exams and cleanings. <br />
            Regular checkups and cleanings can help keep your teeth healthy and catch any potential issues early on.
          </li>

          <li class="text-base sm:text-lg text-zinc-800">
            Consider touch-up treatments. <br />
            Depending on your habits and lifestyle, you may need touch-up treatments every few months to maintain your desired level of whitening.
